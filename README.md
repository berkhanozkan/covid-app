# covidapp


A flutter application which displays the coronavirus data of selected country on chart using API. It's developed using Provider



##Thanks

I used [country_picker](https://pub.dev/packages/country_picker) package for countries that listed in dropdown and used this [covid api](https://github.com/javieraviles/covidAPI) to get datas.

For design : It's free. [simantOo](https://dribbble.com/shots/11015463-Covid-19-App-Free) only used 3 images and card shapes.
