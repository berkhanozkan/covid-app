# covidapp


A flutter application which displays the coronavirus data of selected country on chart using API. It's developed using Provider

I used  
[country_picker](https://pub.dev/packages/country_picker) package for countries that listed in dropdown and used this [api](https://github.com/javieraviles/covidAPI) to get datas.

Thank you
